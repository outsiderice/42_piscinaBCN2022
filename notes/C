gcc -o liet's you name directly the output of the compilation (instead of default a.out)

*search 'swap' in regard to memory

CHAR

%lu size of char <only char?>, %d number of char in ascii<only?> table, %c ascii value aka letter

INT

4:40

POINTERS

WAYS TO DECLARE A POINTER VARIABLE

1-	int* myNum;	<most used>
2-	int	*myNum;
3-	int * myNum;

to declare a pointer it still needs a type.

"%p"	--> returns address;
"%d"	--> returns content;

ptr = &a;	--> this pointer has the address of a;
